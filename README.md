just an old project to put something on my public github.

it fetches data from the RMV-Api (https://www.rmv.de/hapi)
I couldn't get it to work purely with JS, because Crome blocks cross-origin-requests, so I had to make the request with php, so it won't work out of the box.

you can see a non-functioning demo here: http://ansgar.bplaced.net, but chrome also blocks some elements, which make it non-functional. To make it work again I would need to rent some webspace with https and php and currently it's not worth for me.

This project is just to not have an empty github account.
